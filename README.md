In this version, after the employee login, this employee can see his or her leave applications, he/she can select how many records to show in one page. 
According to the requirement, the Employee could decide to update or delete the leave application before the leave is approved or rejected. In such cases the status is changed to ‘Updated’/‘Deleted’. The Employee may also cancel an ‘Approved’ leave, in which case the status is changed to ‘Cancelled’, so I combined the delete and cancel methods in controller. 
I deleted the error.html
I put the employee leave management below detail, also added a leave-detail.HTML page.
